High Priority
- Expand / organize tests
- Write "real" test application using the library
- Work on reducing code duplication
- Integrate / link with C code

Medium/Low Priority
- Parse command line arg to allow skipping basic tests
- Figure out how to link to includes without explicit path

Larger Changes
- Next-fit allocation instead of first-fit
- Best-fit allocation?

Optimizations
- Change PACK, or add DE_ALLOCATE function so you can just flip the
allocated bit instead of recalculating size
