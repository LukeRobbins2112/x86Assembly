High Priority
- Expand / organize tests
- Write "real" test application using the library
- Work on reducing code duplication

Medium/Low Priority
- Parse command line arg to allow skipping basic tests


Optimizations
- Change PACK, or add DE_ALLOCATE function so you can just flip the
allocated bit instead of recalculating size
